# Simon-game

This repository contains the code for a *Simon Game* built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simon is a classic memory game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. This project is a fun and interactive way to practice JavaScript fundamentals, including event handling, timeouts, and DOM manipulation.

# Features

- *Colorful UI*: The game features a simple, yet vibrant user interface with four colored buttons representing different tones.
- *Dynamic Gameplay*: The game generates random sequences of colors and tones that players must replicate.
- *Sound Effects*: Each button press is accompanied by a unique tone, enhancing the gameplay experience.
- *Increasing Difficulty*: As the game progresses, the sequences become longer and more challenging.

# How to Play

1. Start the game by pressing the "Start" button.
2. Watch the sequence of colors and tones that the game displays.
3. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the colored buttons in the correct order.
4. The game will add one more color to the sequence after each successful round.
5. Try to keep up as the sequence becomes longer!
